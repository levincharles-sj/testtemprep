Got it 👍 — thanks for clarifying. Since your QA audience is new to AI in testing, the content should:

* Start with a **clear intro/problem statement**
* Introduce the **tool and vendor**
* Explain **what AI did**
* End with the **measurable results and impact**

Here’s a concise and structured version:

**Case Study: GoCardless – Cutting Test Runtime by 80% with AI**

GoCardless, a global payments provider, was struggling with **long CI test runtimes (up to 300 minutes)**, slowing down developer feedback and releases.

To solve this, they adopted **CloudBees Smart Test**, powered by **Launchable’s AI/ML predictive test selection**. This tool analyzes code changes and past results to **predict which tests are most likely to fail**, so only high-value tests run while low-risk ones are skipped.

The results were dramatic: **test runtime dropped by \~80% (300 mins → 48 mins)**, compute load was cut in half (**8.5K machine hours saved in the first month**), and developers got feedback much faster.

**Outcome:** Faster pipelines, reduced costs, and higher productivity – a clear example of how **AI in QA delivers real-world ROI**.

Would you like me to also add a **1–2 line “takeaway”** (like a guidance note) at the end, showing QA teams how they could explore similar AI tools in their own projects?
