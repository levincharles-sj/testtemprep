## 📈 **Slide 3: Manual vs Automation – AI’s Role in Both**

**Title:** _“AI Enhances Every Tester’s Workflow”_

### 🧍 Manual Testing:
- 🧠 AI helps identify **high-risk areas** for exploratory testing.
- 📝 Suggests **missing test cases** based on historical bugs.
- 🔍 Assists in **visual testing** and UI anomaly detection.

### 🤖 Automation Testing:
- 🔄 Maintains scripts with **self-healing locators**.
- 🧪 Generates **data-driven tests** automatically.
- 📊 Provides **real-time feedback** and failure clustering.

**Real-World Impact:**
- 🚀 Faster release cycles
- 🧩 Fewer missed bugs
- 🧠 Smarter decision-making
