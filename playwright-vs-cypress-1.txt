Got it üëç Since this is for new recruits, the slides should be **clear, visually structured, and not overloaded with text**, but still cover **all the key aspects** (features, benefits, advantages, ecosystem). I‚Äôll draft **6 slides (3 for Playwright + 3 for Cypress)** with bullet-point content you can directly use in PowerPoint/Google Slides.

‚úÖ These slides strike a balance: not too basic, but also not overly technical for beginners. They highlight **capabilities, features, and advantages** clearly.

Do you want me to also **add a comparison slide (Playwright vs Cypress)** so recruits can easily see when to use which?
